## DO NOT ERASE THE TEMPLATE

## FIRST-HAND CHECK - ARE YOU USING THE LATEST VERSION/SNAPSHOT OF HEADSPLUS? Have you checked to see if others have submitted the same feature request? 
State here when you have checked the following points above.

### Description of request
Describe your feature/improvement request here. How do you think it'll help the plugin improve?

### To ensure that the plugin stays original, HeadsPlus will not be taking requests that already exist within actively updated plugins, such as HeadsDatabase and LeaderHeads (this one of which is not close to HeadsPlus whatsoever and shares no features, however is often mistaken as that).
State here you're aware that your feature does not exist in regularly updating "sister" plugins.

### Additional information
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

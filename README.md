# We moved!

After several issues with trying to support multiple versions in one jar AND allow collaboration, HeadsPlus has been moved to this shiny, new repo instead of the old stale one which I made two years ago when still learning how to code. There's a lot we still need to move over here, such as the wiki, but other than that - we're ready for combat!

# Protecting the HeadsPlus Project
In order to settle what is and isn't acceptable use of the HeadsPlus Project (the Plugin), there are some guidelines that need to be followed to ensure the safety of the Plugin. By downloading the Plugin and installing it for the first time on your server, you are automatically agreeing to the Terms of Service of the Plugin.

Unlike most Terms of Service documents, this is not a legal agreement, and I will not be pressing charges against anyone who breaches the document, however if required I will be enforcing and referencing to this document. This also rules out responsibilities between me (the Author) and you (the User).

## Usage
When you download the plugin, it is often most preferred that you install it on your server, whether your server is a production server and thus open to the public, a private one for you and other selected individuals to join, or a test one for you to customise and tailor the Plugin to how you like.

If you are installing it on a server where you have administrator permissions but do not officially own the server, it is preferable that you request permission first from a figure of higher authority before proceeding with installation.

When using the Plugin, it is most preferable that you do not use it to do the following:
- Harass or degrade other Users,
- Trolling, personal or political attacks
- Publishing other Users' personal information without their explicit permission
- Sexual statements/acts that are intended to be malicious or degrade another User

How you use the Plugin will not make responsibility fall on me, but the Users instead.

## Distribution
I do get this question regularly asking if the Plugin can be reuploaded to other sites. This will also cover what happens when the Plugin is abandoned, either explicitly through an announcement or implicitly.

Before reuploading the plugin to other sites, you must request permission from me. By requesting permission, you must agree to the following:
- Full credit to me, the Author, must be given.
- The Plugin, including the plugin.yml file and configuration, must remain untouched.
- You understand a decent amount of the Plugin so if anyone requests help, they can have their queries answered.
- You must not degrade the Plugin or the Author in any way.

I also have guidelines on when the Plugin can be forked and reuploaded on HeadsPlus's primary source, SpigotMC. As of currently, no user is eligible to do the such. It will only be possible when:
- It is explicitly stated that the HeadsPlus Project has been abandoned by the Author.
- 365 days have passed since the last update.
- The Author has gone inactive abruptly without warning for at least six months.

## Commercial use
The majority of features in HeadsPlus are considered primarily cosmetic - meaning you are free to sell the majority of features such as custom heads from the GUI. However, HeadsPlus also aims to be compliant with [Mojang's commercial usage guidelines](https://account.mojang.com/terms#commercial), of which states that you are free to sell entitlements provided that they do not negatively impact on another User's experience, or provide a competitive gameplay advantage.

This is defined by two Users having identical skill levels, time investment and circumstances - if one is provided an advantage over the other, it is considered competitive.

A feature which may provide competitive gameplay advantages or even negatively impact a player's experience is masks, which apply provided potion effects to the User when they are worn. This means that you cannot sell masks for hard currency due to infringement of Mojang's commercial guidelines.

## Communication
When a User requires assistance regarding the plugin, they are absolutely free to come to me, the Author. However, I do want to give a few points in regards to this:

- As of currently (10/05/20, 10th May), I am residing in the U.K, meaning I may not be available when you are. Support cannot currently be supplied 24/7.
- My primary language is English, and a lot of the time, it is preferable that you communicate with me in that language. You are allowed to use a translator if you cannot speak the language. The support Discord's co-owner, Niestrat99, is able to speak fluent German, but may not be able to supply full support for the plugin.

When requesting for assistance, please keep it within either:
- [HeadsPlus's Discussion Thread](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/headsplus-1-8-x-1-15-x.237088/)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/eu8h3BG)
- [Github's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Thatsmusic99/HeadsPlus/issues)

You will receive little to no support if you proceed to request assistance in the following areas:
- The Review section of HeadsPlus
- The Spigot forums/Discord itself
- Other social media such as Twitter and Reddit

In addition to this, when you are requesting support, it is recommended that you:
- Make sure your request is clear, otherwise I will ask for further clarity to make sure I am answering your question.
- When sending an error, include it to its fullest rather than just the top line. If you believe any extra information is necessary, then do provide it.
- When requesting new features, do not attempt to enforce them upon me, e.g. asking me when X will come out, telling me to "hurry up", etc. - some features may not even be possible to introduce.
- Keep in compliance with the rules of the support service you are using:
  - For HP's Discussion thread on Spigot, you can find the rules [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-rules/)
  - In the support/community Discord, you can find the rules in the #rules channel.
  - On Github's issue tracker, you can find our Code of Conduct [here](https://github.com/Thatsmusic99/HeadsPlus/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 - Use the support services appropriately.
 - Keep in mind that I do not support private forks from other authors; those are likely to contain breaking changes which I have no association with.
 - Please do not underestimate or even overestimate my ability as the main developer - if there is something I can't do, then it is not possible as of currently. You are as always free to open a pull request.
 
 ## Damage caused by HeadsPlus
 HeadsPlus itself is a very stable plugin which has been maintained for over three years and a lot of the time will continue to do so. There are also incredibly rare occasions where the plugin may cause damage to gameplay, or may even have the potential to crash a server if the plugin is not provided with the appropriate resources, or ends up in a loop which breaks the plugin altogether.
 
 As the Author, I strive to look for these incredibly damaging bugs before a new release is made officially on SpigotMC. On a rare occasion, one bug may slip past me if the source of the bug is not tested appropriately, resulting in damage to the server. What I personally define as damage is listed below:
 - If the server suffers from memory leaks caused by the Plugin
 - If the server crashes, with its cause being the Plugin
 - The removal or addition of items which are either unrelated to the Plugin or achieved using exploits
 - The removal or addition of competitive advantages through exploits
 
 If you identify any damage which has been caused by HeadsPlus:
 - Attempt to identify the steps it requires to reproduce the bug whilst trying to reduce any damage caused
 - 
 
 ## Enforcement
 For the most part, I will let off those who may not comply with the Terms of Service appropriately, as HeadsPlus is a free plugin either ways, and I do not see the point in enforcing incredibly strict rules on its users. As I mentioned before, this document is not a legal agreement, and is rather desired usage of the plugin.
 
 However, there are more serious offences which I will not take as lightly, and will be responding to as appropriate. Responses can include:
 - A stern warning as a start.
 -

# Protecting the HeadsPlus Project
In order to settle what is and isn't acceptable use of the HeadsPlus Project (the Plugin), there are some guidelines that need to be followed to ensure the safety of the Plugin. By downloading the Plugin and installing it for the first time on your server, you are automatically agreeing to the Terms of Service of the Plugin.

Please do note that this is not a legal agreement, and I will not be pressing charges against anyone who breaches the terms of service, however if required I will be enforcing and referencing to this document. This also rules out responsibilities between me (the Author) and you (the User).

## Usage
When you download the plugin, it is often most preferred that you install it on your server, whether your server is a production server and thus open to the public, a private one for you and other selected individuals to join, or a test one for you to customise and tailor the Plugin to how you like.

If you are installing it on a server where you have administrator permissions but do not officially own the server, it is preferable that you request permission first from a figure of higher authority before proceeding with installation.

When using the Plugin, it is most preferable that you do not use it to do the following:
- Harass or degrade other Users,
- Trolling, personal or political attacks
- Publishing other Users' personal information without their explicit permission
- Sexual statements/acts that are intended to be malicious or degrade another User

## Distribution
I do get this question regularly asking if the Plugin can be reuploaded to other sites. This will also cover what happens when the Plugin is abandoned, either explicitly through an announcement or implicitly.

Before reuploading the plugin to other sites, you must request permission from me. By requesting permission, you must agree to the following:
- Full credit to me, the Author, must be given.
- The Plugin, including the plugin.yml file and configuration, must remain untouched.
- You understand a decent amount of the Plugin so if anyone requests help, they can have their queries answered.
- You must not degrade the Plugin or the Author in any way.

I also have guidelines on when the Plugin can be forked and reuploaded on HeadsPlus's primary source, SpigotMC. As of currently, no user is eligible to do the such. It will only be possible when:
- It is explicitly stated that the HeadsPlus Project has been abandoned by the Author.
- 365 days have passed since the last update.
- The Author has gone inactive abruptly without warning for at least six months.

## Commercial use
The majority of features in HeadsPlus are considered primarily cosmetic - meaning you are free to sell the majority of features such as custom heads from the GUI. However, HeadsPlus also aims to be compliant with [Mojang's commercial usage guidelines](https://account.mojang.com/terms#commercial), of which states that you are free to sell entitlements provided that they do not negatively impact on another User's experience, or provide a competitive gameplay advantage.

This is defined by two Users having identical skill levels, time investment and circumstances - if one is provided an advantage over the other, it is considered competitive.

A feature which may provide competitive gameplay advantages or even negatively impact a player's experience is masks, which apply provided potion effects to the User when they are worn. This means that you cannot sell masks for hard currency due to infringement of Mojang's commercial guidelines.
